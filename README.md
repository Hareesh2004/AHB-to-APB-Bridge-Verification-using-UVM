# AHB-to-APB-Bridge-Verification-using-UVM
This project verifies the RTL design of an AHB to APB Bridge using SystemVerilog and UVM. It includes a self-checking testbench, functional coverage, assertions, and protocol validation. Built using Synopsys VCS and debugged with Verdi, it strengthens understanding of AMBA protocols and verification flow.
